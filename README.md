what aircraft is overhead?

[https://whatsoverhead.rickt.dev](https://whatsoverhead.rickt.dev)

[front](https://github.com/rickt/whatsoverhead/tree/main/frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/rickt/whatsoverhead/tree/main/backend) src for a simple "what aircraft is overhead" app.

[backend](https://github.com/rickt/whatsoverhead/tree/main/backend) is python, uses the free [adsb.fi](https://adsb.fi) [ADS-B API](https://github.com/adsbfi/opendata/blob/main/README.md), i deployed to GCP Cloud Run but you can put it wherever. 

[frontend](https://github.com/rickt/whatsoverhead/tree/main/frontend) is simple HTML + JS.

## inspiration
inspiration for this came from John Wiseman's [whatsoverhead.com](https://whatsoverhead.com), which i loved! i wanted to know how it works and ended up writing my own version.
